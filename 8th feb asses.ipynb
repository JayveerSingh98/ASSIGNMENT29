    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables us to model complex systems by breaking \n",
    "them down into simpler, more manageable pieces. It is the process of hiding the internal details of an object or a system and \n",
    "exposing only the relevant and necessary information to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes, interfaces, and methods. An abstract class is a class\n",
    "that cannot be instantiated, but can be used as a template for creating concrete subclasses. An interface, on the other hand,\n",
    "is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of a vehicle. A vehicle is an abstraction of various types of vehicles like cars, bikes, trucks, etc.\n",
    "We don't need to know the internal details of how an engine works or how the transmission is connected to the wheels to use a vehicle.\n",
    "We only need to know how to drive it, how fast it can go, how much fuel it consumes, and how to stop it. These are the essential \n",
    "properties and behaviors of a vehicle that we need to know to use it effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can create an abstract class called \"Vehicle\" that contains the essential properties and methods that are common to all\n",
    "types of vehicles. For example, it may have properties like \"speed,\" \"fuel consumption,\" and \"braking system,\" and methods like \n",
    "\"start,\" \"stop,\" \"accelerate,\" and \"brake.\" Then we can create concrete subclasses like \"Car,\" \"Bike,\" and \"Truck\" that inherit\n",
    "from the \"Vehicle\" class and add their specific properties and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using abstraction, we can create a hierarchy of classes that represents the real-world system in a simplified and organized manner. \n",
    "We can also make our code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain."

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Though they are related, they are different concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details from the user and exposing only the essential features of an object or a system.\n",
    "On the other hand, encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface for accessing\n",
    "and manipulating its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example to understand the difference between abstraction and encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are designing a banking system that involves various transactions like deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. We can create a class\n",
    "called \"BankAccount\" that represents a bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: In this case, abstraction refers to the process of identifying the essential features of a bank account and hiding the unnecessary details. \n",
    "For example, the essential features of a bank account are the account holder's name, account number, balance, and the ability to perform transactions. \n",
    "We can hide the unnecessary details like how the transactions are executed or how the account balance is stored. This is achieved through abstraction,\n",
    "by creating an abstract class called \"BankAccount\" that contains only the essential properties and methods of a bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the process of hiding the internal details of a bank account and providing a public interface for accessing and\n",
    "manipulating its state. We can achieve encapsulation by making the properties of the \"BankAccount\" class private and providing public methods for accessing \n",
    "and modifying them. For example, we can make the balance property private and provide public methods like \"deposit,\" \"withdraw,\" and \"getBalance\" to access \n",
    "and modify the balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction is about hiding the unnecessary details, while encapsulation is about hiding the internal details and providing a public interface\n",
